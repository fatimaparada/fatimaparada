### Hello, StrangersðŸ‘‹
My github page is currently under construction. I am trying to organize and find all projects I have created in all languages I am proficient and familiar in.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Julia and Matlab for Cognitive and Neural Modeling and how to use C++ for Computer Vision. 
- ðŸ“« Connect with me on linkedin! https://linkedin.com/in/fatimapt/
- View my codepen directly for HTML5: https://codepen.io/fatimaparada
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to have a pet squirrel and opossum. Now I have a cat named Fiji. I just love small animals including rats and mice.
