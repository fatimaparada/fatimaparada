### Hi there 👋
My github page is currently under construction. I am trying to organize and find all projects I have created in all languages I am proficient and familiar in.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Julia and Matlab for Cognitive and Neural Modeling and how to use C++ for Computer Vision. 
- 📫 Connect with me on linkedin! https://linkedin.com/in/fatimapt/
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to have a pet squirrel and opossum. Now I have a cat named Fiji. I just love small animals including rats and mice.
